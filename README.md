# Predictability Over Discretion

**How Rule Design Shapes Trust, Behavior, and Enforcement**

This repository contains an original, survey-based policy analysis examining how users evaluate predictable, rule-based platform policies versus discretionary, case-by-case review when they are personally subject to enforcement.

Using an original survey of 185 respondents, the paper compares user preferences between an automatic, time-based refund policy and discretionary review by product support. Results show a strong preference for predictable rules, suggesting that certainty and speed often outweigh individualized judgment in user-facing enforcement contexts.
